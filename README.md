     Welcome to my repository and it's my pleasure to meet you! I like to share knowledge and solve problems and in my perspective, technology is a means to achieve these goals. I currently work as a Software Developer in a  Portuguese Company. I've been dedicating my time  updating my knowledge about IT learning about Microservices, Java, Spring, and Frontend development with Angular.
